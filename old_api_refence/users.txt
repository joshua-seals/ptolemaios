Users List

UsersViewSet - ViewSet for managing user information.

This ViewSet provides endpoints to retrieve details of the currently logged-in user
and to handle user logout.

Endpoints:
- List User Details:
- URL: /users/
- HTTP Method: GET
- Method: list
- Description: Provides details of the currently logged-in user, including their
username and access token. This endpoint is designed to support
scenarios where a reverse proxy (like nginx) performs authentication
before proxying a request.

- Logout:
- URL: /users/logout/
- HTTP Method: POST
- Method: logout
- Description: Logs out the current user and returns a success message.

Note:
- The ViewSet uses a private method '_get_access_token' to retrieve the user's
access token from the session.
- 'EmptySerializer' is used for the 'logout' action, likely to simply validate the
request without any specific data.
