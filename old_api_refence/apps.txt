AppViewSet - ViewSet for managing Tycho apps.

This ViewSet provides endpoints to list all available apps and retrieve details
about a specific app based on its app_id.

Endpoints:
- List All Apps:
- URL: /apps/
- HTTP Method: GET
- Method: list
- Description: Lists all available apps, parses resource specifications,
and returns them in a structured format. GPU reservations
and limits are specially handled. Any errors during the
parsing of an app's data are logged and the app is skipped.

- Retrieve App Details:
- URL: /apps/{app_id}/
- HTTP Method: GET
- Method: retrieve
- Description: Provides detailed information about a specific app based on its
app_id. Similar to the list method, it parses resource specifications
and returns them in a structured format.

Note:
- The app_id is used as a lookup field.
- The ViewSet interacts with an external system named 'tycho' to fetch app definitions
and other relevant data. There are also utility functions like 'parse_spec_resources'
and 'search_for_gpu_reservation' that are presumably defined elsewhere in the codebase.
